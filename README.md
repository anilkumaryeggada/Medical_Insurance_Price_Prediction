# Medical_Insurance_Price_PredictionMedical Insurance Price Prediction
Overview

This project aims to predict the medical insurance costs for individuals based on their demographic and health-related factors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we develop a model that provides accurate cost predictions, which can help insurance companies optimize pricing and improve customer satisfaction.
Features

    Predicts medical insurance prices using machine learning algorithms.
    Utilizes a dataset with features like age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.
    Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
    Visualizes relationships between predictors and insurance charges.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following attributes:

    Age: Age of the individual.
    Gender: Male or Female.
    BMI: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
    Children: Number of children covered by health insurance.
    Smoker: Smoking status (Yes/No).
    Region: Geographical region (e.g., Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest).
    Charges: Medical insurance cost (target variable).

Prerequisites

    Python 3.8 or above
    Libraries:
        pandas
        numpy
        matplotlib
        seaborn
        scikit-learn

Project Workflow

    Data Preprocessing:
        Handle missing values (if any).
        Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, smoker, region).
        Scale numerical features like BMI and age.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Visualize the relationship between features and target charges using scatter plots, box plots, and histograms.
        Analyze outliers and trends in the data.

    Feature Engineering:
        Create interaction features, if necessary, to improve model performance.

    Model Training:
        Train models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
        Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

    Model Selection and Deployment:
        Choose the best-performing model.
        Save the trained model using joblib or pickle for deployment.

Results

    The best-performing model achieved an R-squared score of X.XX and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of Y.YY on the test dataset.

Future Work

    Integrate additional features like health history and lifestyle choices.
    Experiment with deep learning models for improved predictions.
    Build a web application using Streamlit or Flask for user interaction.
